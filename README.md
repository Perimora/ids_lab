# Task 4: Identify IDS Alerts for a Port Scan

## Overview
This task focuses on identifying IDS alerts generated by a port scan using an open-source network intrusion detection system. The chosen system is Suricata.

## Environment
- Virtual machine as target
- Suricata installed as the IDS
- Nmap used for conducting the port scan

## Steps Performed
1. Created a dedicated folder to collect alerts, rules, scripts, and configuration files.
2. Set up a virtual machine as the scan target.
3. Installed Suricata and configured it with a custom rule set focused on port scan detection.
4. Conducted a port scan using Nmap:
   - Example command: `nmap -sS -p- -T4 -Pn <target-ip>`
5. Investigated the generated alerts in Suricata's `fast.log` and `eve.json`.
6. Filtered out unrelated events.

## Findings
- One event was analyzed in detail, including its signature, timestamp, source and destination IPs, and ports.
- Total number of alerts received for the port scan was recorded.
- Challenges identified:
  - Distinguishing between legitimate traffic and scan-related alerts
  - Handling high volumes of alerts during large or slow scans
  - Fine-tuning rules to balance detection and false positives

## Note
Depending on the network intrusion detection system and the active rule set, no alerts may be triggered if port scan detection rules are disabled.
