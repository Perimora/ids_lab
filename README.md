# Lab: Inline Gateway with Suricata IDS

This lab simulates a network security environment with an inline Layer-3 Gateway that mirrors all traffic to a Suricata IDS.

## ðŸ”¹ Core Concept

**Goal:**
- Simulate adversary attacks (nmap, ICMP, HTTP probes)
- Traffic is routed through an inline **Gateway**
- Gateway mirrors all traffic to **Suricata IDS** via **tc-mirred** (Layer-2 mirroring)

**Traffic Flow:**

```
Adversary (external-net)
    â‡¨ Gateway (external-net)
        â‡¨ Gateway (production-net)
            â‡¨ Target (production-net)
Response:
Target â‡¨ Gateway (production-net) â‡¨ Gateway (external-net) â‡¨ Adversary
Meanwhile:
Traffic â‡¨ mirrored from Gateway eth0/eth1 â‡¨ eth2 (sensor-net) â‡¨ Suricata
```

## ðŸ”¹ Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| **adversary** | Attack simulation (nmap, curl, custom scans) |
| **gateway** | Layer-3 router & inline TAP (tc-mirred traffic mirroring) |
| **target** | Production server (SSH and Nginx) |
| **suricata** | IDS to monitor mirrored traffic |

## ðŸ”¹ Important Details

- **IP forwarding** is enabled on the Gateway.
- **tc-mirred** is used for real Layer-2 traffic mirroring:
  - eth0 (external-net) â‡¨ mirrored to eth2
  - eth1 (production-net) â‡¨ mirrored to eth2
- **Suricata** listens on eth0 inside sensor-net.
- **Privileged Mode** is enabled where needed (for tc and net admin).
- **No NAT**, pure IP routing (transparent Gateway).

## ðŸ”¹ Quick Start

1. Move into docker folder:

```bash
cd docker
```

2. Start all containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Verify services:

```bash
docker ps
```

4. Test traffic:
- From adversary: `ping 172.30.0.3`
- Launch nmap scans: `nmap -p 22,80,443 172.30.0.3`

5. Monitor mirrored traffic:
- On gateway:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it gateway bash
  tcpdump -i eth2 -n
  ```
- On Suricata:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it suricata bash
  tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
  ```

## ðŸ”¹ Notes

- Ensure tc-mirrored setup runs inside gateway container (`/tmp/tc.sh`).
- The gateway must stay privileged to control traffic redirection.
- Target container has default route set to Gateway.
- Adversary routes via Gateway to reach production targets.

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps

- Expand attack simulations
- Tune Suricata rulesets
- Introduce threat hunting scenarios
- Visualize traffic flows with live dashboards
